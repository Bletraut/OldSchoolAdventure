## Educational fair use

ZenithMoon Studios is allowing derivative works for **educational purposes** only (e.g. learning MonoGame or learning to make games) under these conditions:

- Obligation to detail which part is being used or modified

## Repository content

This repository contains both the game source code and its level editor.

The code has been migrated to MonoGame from its original XNA source, updated and tested to be working.

The code and content is found in the [Source](/Source/) folder with the following directories:

- [Source\Destiny](/Source/Destiny/) - Engine style code for the Old School Adventure.
- [Source\OldSchoolAdventure](/Source/OldSchoolAdventure/) - Main game implementation code.
- [Source\OldSchoolAdventure\Content](/Source/OldSchoolAdventure/Content/) - All game content and xml configuration files.
- [Source\ThirdParty](/Source/ThirdParty/) - Original platform addons, no longer used but added for reference.

> [!NOTE]
> While the solution uses XML for the configuration of the title, the implementation is not "best practice" for future MonoGame development as XML serializers are not recommended for MonoGame titles due to their limited support for consoles and NativeAoT.

## Documentation - a work in progress

Documentation will follow the initial release.

Some elements of the functionality are included but are no longer in use as they were added for the Windows Phone release, namely:

- ThirdParty\AccelerometerHelper - uses redundant Accelerometer API and needs updating.
- ThirdParty\EasyStorage - Relies on XNA StorageDevice implementation, needs new storage access (although saving/loading functionality has been updated for MonoGame)

## This is not a community project

This repository sole purpose is for educational use.
